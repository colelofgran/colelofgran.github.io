<h1 style=font-size:35px>Impero Screen Monitoring</h1>
<h1 style=font-size:35px>Impero works by searching for connected computers on the network. Therefore You can simpily change the wifi network to blind imperos view. In school you might notice that there are only school owned wifi networks. A solution for this is wifi hotspots, you can only make hotspots with cell service.<h1>
<h1 style=font-size:35px>Impero WebBlocking</h1>
<h1 style=font-size:35px>There are several ways the school blocks websites. This method only works if you see the Impero warning. To do this, get the url of your website, and type it in your address bar. DO NOT HIT ENTER. Now close your chromebook, the open it up. Sign in as fast as you can. Then, as soon as you can hit enter, DO IT. I belive this works because your chromebook when closed  stops impero, but your not giving it enough time to turn back on, and detect it.<h1>
